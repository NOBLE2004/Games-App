# Android MVP Base Architecture for Enterprise Mobile Application using Architectural Components

# Highlights

1. MVP Architectural pattern
2. Offline Support sql Room
3. Unit test demonstration using JUnit and Mockito
4. Kotlin



The application has been built with **offline support**. It has been designed using **Android Architecture components** with **Room** for offline data caching. The application is built in such a way that whenvever there is a service call, the result will be stored in local database.

The whole application is built based on the MVP architectural pattern.

The main advantage of using MVP, the itractor will connects to db / network and fetch the data , and it will pass to presenter where business 
logic is writter , Then presenter will update view accordingly



# Programming Practices Followed
a) Android Architectural Components <br/>
b) Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection <br/>
c) MVP <br/>
d) Retrofit with Okhttp <br/>
e) Room for data caching <br/>
f) JUnit and Mockito for Unit testing <br/>
d) RX Java <br/>


# How to build ?

Open terminal and type the below command to generate debug build <br/>

``` ./gradlew assembleDebug ```

Open terminal and type the below command to generate release build <br/>

``` ./gradlew assembleRelease ```

## Test cases

see android test and test packages

## Suggestions
we must use pagination since the data rows are larger
